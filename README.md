# Cataschevastica-Data Warehouse, Analytics and Visualization

The Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) Cataschevastica Database DB, which has been
designed in the previous assignment, is used for handling transactional workloads in the
real-time or near real-time environment of the company. In this project, a Data Warehouse (DW)
will be designed for analytical purposes. The trainees will analyse the needs, define the fact and
dimension tables, design its structure, implement the Extract Load Transformation (ETL)
procedure, perform analytical calculations, provide visualisations and produce managerial
dashboards. For the analysis of data from various factories the data will be concentrated in a
delta lake managed by Databricks. Finally, the visual reports and dashboards will be designed
using the Power BI Desktop tool
